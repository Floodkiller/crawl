# Security Policy for Gooncrawl

Last updated Apr 2020.

## Supported Versions

Support is only provided for the latest unstable version. Support will include
any vulnerability fixes generated on the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup fork as well as
fixes for anything found by Gooncrawl contributors.

Online servers generally run a webtiles server version drawn from trunk,so any
vulnerability in an up-to-date webtiles server is covered (e.g. in the python code).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the issue is exclusive to the Gooncrawl fork, open an issue on github in this
repository or contact anyone with repo access.

If the issue is not exclusive to the Gooncrawl fork and can occur in all Dungeon
Crawl forks, please follow the SECURITY.md instructions in the Dungeon Crawl
Stone Soup fork (to ensure that the fix can be spread to other Dungeon Crawl forks
easily).
