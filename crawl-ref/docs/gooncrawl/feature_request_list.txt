List of requested features goes here (as well as my feedback on what needs to be
done to implement and likelihood of implementation in the near future). Feature 
is not guaranteed to go in unless it receives majority approval from the SA Crawl 
thread.

*=My notes, just talking about what's needed and the amount of work. Is not 
indicative of likelihood to implement feature, but may be an indicator as to how
 much time it will take to implement it.
-------------------
more crabs +1000

*Takes time and vague, create a specific implementation
-------------------
New muts???

*Will take work to implement, so work on designs until one has a specific design to
  be voted upon and I will look into putting it in depending on how complex it gets.
-------------------
Feature Request: Donald

*But he's still in the game. Do you mean Wiglaf?
-------------------
Jester class

*I would need to find the April Fool's fork it is located in to see how much work it
  would take to implement.
-------------------
Multi-same slot equips for species

*I would need to look into how Octopodes do it, and it probably won't be easy to adapt.
-------------------
New spells

*Need to flesh out specific designs before implementing, and anything that uses an
  effect not already within the game will take more effort to create. Will likely 
  need to set up an open "Design" section on wiki to map out a non-existing spell for 
  design before suggesting for feature implementation.
-------------------
Bring back Hive

*Can probably look at the Nostalgia branch on how to do this, but will likely take
   some more work beyond that. Could also be a timed portal, but that might be 
   equally hard (looking at Desolation instead for an example).
-------------------
Re-Add Repel Missiles spell

*Should be simple
-------------------
Add new unique monsters

*Need to have an exact design (stats, dungeon range, abilities, etc.) to have a 
  concise idea for voting/implementing.
-------------------
Change the rare wands (if brought back) into uncommon evocables instead of wands

*Would need to work out a design for each if doing this, and they would probably be 
  more effort to implement than reverting a previously existing wand+zap effect.
-------------------
Wand of Teleport to Wand of Teleport Other

*Should be fairly easy to port over from the spell
-------------------
Jiyva Zealot

*Would need to work out what stat boosts/skill distribution/starting equipment it 
  receives
-------------------
Guaranteed Wizlab/other portals

*where should they be guaranteed? should random ones still occur if a permanent one
  is placed? can probably copy over static placement from perma-bazaars
-------------------
Goldify spellbooks

*I forget if Hellcrawl already did this, I think it did. Would have to investigate 
  how reliant it is on Hellcrawl specific code, and interactions with book amnesia 
  if re-implemented.
-------------------
Achievements

*I remember the official dev team was working on them for a while, but then stopped;
  I forget the reason why, but likely because it was a lot of work to integrate with
  the rest of the game.
-------------------
Jiyva altar guaranteed outside Slime entrance

*I guess this can be discussed regardless of whether or not it passes getting added
  to Temple lists. It's pretty easy to modify all Slime entrance vaults to add a 
  Jiyva altar, so no issue implementing.
-------------------
Poison Magic rework/new spells/acid spells/removal

*Needs lots of design. Either what new direction should be, what new spells to add 
  and what they do, or where to relocate existing spells if removal of the spell 
  school occurs. Will probably take a lot of effort.
-------------------
Archaeologist/Skill locked chests

*SteelNeuron already made most of it, so only some minor code updates to implement 
  if desired.
-------------------
Skeleton species

*Same as above
-------------------
Battlesphere back in Cj starter book

*Pretty simple to swap spells between books
-------------------
Spawn more bazaars

*Would need to add more perma-bazaars to existing vaults, or increase chance
  to spawn bazaar portal (potentially allowing for multiple timed bazaar portals
  to spawn). Might take some work to track down chance rate, not as much work to 
  increase vault spawned bazaars.
-------------------
Rework Jiyva

*Needs a good design to decide to rework into. Will also likely take some work to
  track down which numbers affect certain aspects of Jiyva to tweak them for minor 
  changes.
-------------------
Bring back Haste spell

*Should be easy to revert
-------------------
Disc of storms

*Should be a simple revert
-------------------
Playable boulder beetles

*This looks like a fuckton of work, especially making a player based boulder ability.
  I'll put it on the list anyway.
-------------------
Add Floodkiller as a unique

*If everyone wants it, I don't mind. Needs level spawn ranges, stats, abilities, etc.
-------------------
Remove XP penalty for summons

*May or may not be difficult, depending on how much any supporting systems have changed
  since implementing the penalty 
-------------------
Increase power/reduce timer of XP evokers by number of evokers picked up

*Would need to look into how hard it is to read quantity or add plusses to them
-------------------
Re-add lava orcs and djinni

*Might be lots of work, a lot of that code for both is ancient now.
-------------------
Felid mummies for Tomb

*Maybe make a tile variant for one of the types of mummies?  I don't have art skills for this, though.
-------------------
Brands for unarmed attacks

*Need to figure out the approach for doing so, will likely be difficult regardless.
-------------------
Guarantee a magic (or better) sling for Joseph

*Pretty easy, some uniques already have a chance/guarantee to copy the code from
-------------------
Replace large rocks with cannonballs

*Easy rename/reflavoring, but needs a good tile or what's the point
-------------------
Replace wand of polymorph with a scroll that hits everything on screen

*I have to figure out if polymorph is a valid mass enchantment type. If it is, super easy; if it isn't, might take a bit of work but probably not too bad.
-------------------
Put Battlesphere back in Cj starter book

*Super easy to move spells around between books, 5 minute change tops.
-------------------
Give Deep Dwarves back their recharging ability

*Should be simple, although this would give them two abilities (self heal, recharge).
-------------------
Bring back cTele

*I don't know how much the backend has changed in relation to cTele, which might throw things off. Might still be simple, though.
-------------------
Re-add old unrands

*Mention the specific ones and I'll put it to a vote.
-------------------
Racial armor

*This is a pretty old system, so it might be a pain to bring it back.
-------------------
Add shops/bazaars to Pan

*I 'think' this is probably easy to accomplish
-------------------
Add trowel card effects to Abyss:5

*Depends on if the trowel effect still exists and works in modern Crawl. Otherwise, might be a pain.
-------------------
Old corrosion effects (permanently degrade weapon and armor enchantment)

*Probably not very popular, but putting it on the list anyway. I think this would be pretty easy to put back in.
-------------------
Re-add contaminated/poisonous chunks

*Also probably not popular, but also probably easy to put back in.
-------------------
Re-implement weight system

*This is not popular and also likely a big pain in the ass at this point, because many new things never had mass.
-------------------
Wielded item + spell combos

*Some might be easy to put back in, others not so much.
-------------------
Permanent undead minions

*I think it's pretty easy to re-implement this, just need to find the timers
-------------------
Train by use skilling (victory dancing)

*Probably not popular, and I'm not familiar with the old system. Would likely be a large project.
-------------------
Gnomes

*Gnolls took the abbreviation, so Gnomes would need a new one. Otherwise, bland species additions are easy.
-------------------
Grey Elves

*Pretty easy, but would need to figure out how sparkle ability worked (maybe from nostalgia branch?)
-------------------
Dungeon lengthening (Dungeon to 27, Orc to 3/4, etc.)

*I'll put one in a vote if enough people voice for it. Might turn into a pain the ass (depending on work to redo spawn tables)
-------------------
Old Ignite Poison functionality (auto fire damage to enemies with 'poisonous' chunks)

*With poisoned chunks removed, this might be harder to implement.
-------------------
Clouds working beyond LoS

*I think the change was recent, so it should be easy to revert
-------------------
Rename barachians to hopkins

*Very simple
-------------------
Change Oka weapon gifting

*Depending on implementation request, simple to tough
-------------------
Summonable 'bomber' monsters

*Might be easier to rework Inner Flame to be more flexible than adding a new summon. Otherwise, Summon Flaming Sheep might work?
-------------------
Bring back lightning discussed

*Might be simple, might be tough. Need to look into it.
-------------------


Post angrily at me if I missed something.
