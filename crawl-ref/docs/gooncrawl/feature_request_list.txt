List of requested features goes here (as well as my feedback on what needs to be
done to implement and likelihood of implementation in the near future). Feature 
is not guaranteed to go in unless it receives majority approval from the SA Crawl 
thread.

*=My notes, just talking about what's needed and the amount of work. Is not 
indicative of likelihood to implement feature, but may be an indicator as to how
 much time it will take to implement it.
-------------------

Post angrily at me if I missed something.
