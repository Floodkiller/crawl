The following procedure will be followed when merging from Trunk on the main 
repository:


Major feature changes/additions/removals: 
-Run through the thread first before committing to Gooncrawl.

Minor feature changes/additions/removals: 
-Merge, vote to remove if meeting derision.

Bug Fixes: 
-Auto-merge unless related to a specific feature change that has either not been 
  approved or is pending approval.

UI Changes: 
-Minor fixes/changes/improvements (tile fixes, new tiles, etc.) will be auto-merged 
  unless attached to a feature that has not been merged/changed. 
-Major changes (ex. the noise bar) will be treated as features.

Documentation updates: 
-May or may not get merged depending on above, but I will admit that it will 
  probably fall behind unless I specifically remember or am reminded to update 
  something.
