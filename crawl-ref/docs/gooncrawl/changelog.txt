Gooncrawl Version 2.0 (in perpetual development hell):

Species
----------
-Added Hermit Crabs, a species that can cast easily in most body armors and has big meaty claws for punching, but sucks at melee combat and dislikes transmuting and mutating away from their perfect form
-Added Faerie Dragons, a small draconian-esque species that can cast spells for reduced MP costs
-Added Skeleton species, a fragile undead species with the power to mesmerize themselves against enemies to shave large amounts of damage
-Added Grey Elves, elves who are grey
-Reimplemented Djinni
-Reimplemented Lava Orcs
-Deep Dwarves have the Recharging ability again (keeping their Heal ability as well)
-Banned undead from being Priests
-Renamed Demigods to Prometheans, reduced their XP aptitude penalty to -1, changed stat growth from +2 choice every three levels to +1 random every level/+1 choice every three levels
-Large species can now wield dire flails, great swords, battleaxes, halberds, quarterstaves, and arbalests one handed

Backgrounds
----------
-Added Archaeologists, a background that starts with a manual and a locked box containing an unrandart related to the manual. The box is unlocked when the manual is finished
-Added Slime Apostles, a background that worships Jiyva
-Re-added Reavers (with some spellbook changes)
-Re-added Healer background
-Re-added Jester class, an ex-worshipper of Xom who now follows Nemelex Xobeh and starts with multiple pies

Gods
----------
-XP sharing with orcish followers under Beogh has changed: instead of taking half the player's kill XP and splitting it among all orcs in LoS (with bigger shares going to orcs with more HD), every orc in LoS will now receive the full half.
-Okawaru no longer gives out ammo gifts. Instead, at 3* piety, Okawaru will now make all of the player's ammunition have the returning brand in addition to whatever brand it normally has. Additionally, at 3* of piety and higher Okawaru has a chance to prevent ammunition from being mulched (up to 100% chance to be preserved at 160 piety/6*)

Spells
----------
-New spell: Virulence, a level 4 Hex/Pois spell. When successful, reduces the enemy's poison resistance

-New spell: Iskenderun's Undoing, a level 9 Conjurations spell that summons 8 Orbs of Destruction around you on cast
-New spell: Blades of Disaster, a level 5 Charms spell that summons prisms when hitting enemies during the spell's duration. When the duration runs out, the prisms will explode in a few turns and damage everything in their radius (including the player).
-New spell: Differential Expansion, a level 3 Conjurations/Ice spell that will knock back the next enemy attacked in melee range with an ice-based attack.

-Re-added the Haste spell, increased spell level to 9, re-added Haste contamination
-Re-added the Singularity spell
-Ring of Flames is now radius 2, the flaming clouds overwrite all other clouds, the player's tile is cleared of all clouds, and it only gives rC- instead of rC--
-Gell's Gravitas is 10% more effective
-Alistair's Intoxication is 10% more effective spellpower, confuses enemies more often, vertigos yourself less often
