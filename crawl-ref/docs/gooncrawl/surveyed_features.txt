Features will be gauged on the following criteria:
Thread majority decision is 66% of a vote, yes or no.

Contested votes (votes where no side reaches the majority threshold) will require 
further discussion/design and a future revote before being considered again.

“Yes, with changes” counts as a yes for majority votes.  If a vote wins a Yes 
majority without needing “Yes, with changes”, the feature will be implemented 
without changes and change suggestions will be recorded for future reference if the
thread decides a change needs to be made.  If a vote cannot win a Yes majority 
without needing “Yes, with changes” votes, the feature will be accepted for 
implementation, but a change needs to be decided upon before implementing (likely 
through a vote runoff to ensure a choice is made).

“Fuck off” counts the same as a no for majority votes, other than being a more 
emphatic “No”.  If a No majority wins where “Fuck off” exceeds the number of “No” 
votes, a topic will likely not be considered again unless there is a massive change 
of opinion in the thread.

“I don’t know/I don’t care” votes will use the following Gooncrawl lizard-brain 
philosophy, as long as the number of votes does not meet or exceed all other 
voting categories:
-New stuff/bringing back removed stuff is usually good, so add it (Yes)
-Removals are bad, so don’t do them (No)
-Flavor stuff is always good (Yes)
-The optimal man does not exist, so no changes directly relating to fixing tedium (No)
-Other changes can be good or bad, so tentatively accept them but request discussion 
  (Yes, with changes)

If the number of “I don’t know/I don’t care” votes meets or exceeds the next highest 
category, the feature will follow the rules for a contested vote, regardless of the 
above philosophy.

Features are not set in stone; they can always have a (thread accepted) change later.

This list will be updated as features are surveyed (added to this list) or implemented
(removed from this list).
