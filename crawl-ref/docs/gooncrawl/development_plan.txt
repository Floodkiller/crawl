Needs design questions answered before proceeding (simple implementation)

Re-implement scrolls of recharging
-How should recharging work with wand stacking?  Add charges the same as before, or adjust the numbers (now that wands no longer hit a charge cap)?  Count it as finding another wand of the same type?
Implement scarf and/or cloak wearing for felids
-Just scarves, or scarves and cloaks?
Re-implement boulder beetles
-Where should they spawn (aside from specified vaults)?
-Any stat tweaks before implementing?
Re-implement normal sheep
-Where should they spawn?
-Which vaults should they replace dream sheep in?
-Any stat tweaks before implementing?


Complex implementation (these might get pushed to the next version to get a baseline pushed out)

Re-implement Pakellas (will still require adjusting abilities to stacked wands system)
-What will Quick Charge do with wand stacking?
-Stick with No MP regen+MP on kill?  If so, stick with gifted potion of magic for overflow MP?
-What will Supercharge do with wand stacking?
-Should Pakellas still give gifts?  If so, follow current piety breakpoint gift system (like Kiku’s) or swap to gifts from piety system (like Oka/Sif/Trog)?
Re-implement rods
-What should be done about wand of clouds/wand of scattershot?
-What should be done about ‘lightning rod’ evocable?
-Should rods work as they did before (wield to use) or use a different system?
Rework or remove Malmutate from monster spell lists
-I’ve still got to work this fucker out, I’m not ripping out everything just yet.
Implement ‘permanent buff’ system from Hellcrawl
-Which spells receive the perma buff system, and which will use the current system?
-How complex is it to pull over from Hellcrawl? (something I need to investigate)
-Any adjustments from how Hellcrawl’s system works?
Re-implement hammers (for Crazy Yiuf)
-This is only here because I’ve never messed around with adding a weapon type, it should be easy to insert and make vault adjustments once I read into it
Rework Hell effects
-SKULL.GIF recommended looking for a pre-existing Hell effect rework, so I’ll find and post that first for discussion before trying to go in and reformat it myself
Implement Virulence spell
-Spell level, schools, spellpower cap, any special features (like a spellpower boost)?
-How does the spell work with the different tiers of rPois (-rPois/no resist/+rPois/immune to poison)?
-Need to make sure monsters can be affected by the Virulence effect (it may only be a player-based effect at the moment)
