Features leftover from v1.0 list

Re-implement wands of heal wounds 
- Was buggy, implemented harp of healing
Re-implement wands of teleportation 
- Was buggy, implemented shard of zot
Re-implement Singularity - Was super broken, needs lots of work to fix and bring back
Implement hat wearing for felids 
- Still need to fix Ashenzari interaction with new equip slots
Re-implement spellpower boost for Dragon Call in Dragon Form 
- Need to highlight when spell is boosted
Re-implement Pakellas (will still require adjusting abilities to stacked wands system)
-What will Quick Charge do with wand stacking?
-Stick with No MP regen+MP on kill?  If so, stick with gifted potion of magic for 
  overflow MP?
-What will Supercharge do with wand stacking?
-Should Pakellas still give gifts?  If so, follow current piety breakpoint gift 
  system (like Kiku’s) or swap to gifts from piety system (like Oka/Sif/Trog)?
Re-implement rods
-What should be done about wand of clouds/wand of scattershot?
-What should be done about ‘lightning rod’ evocable?
-Should rods work as they did before (wield to use) or use a different system?
Rework or remove Malmutate from monster spell lists
-Cacodemons and neqoxecs are changed, will wait and see about orbs of fire and shining eyes
Implement ‘permanent buff’ system from Hellcrawl
-Which spells receive the perma buff system, and which will use the current system?
-How complex is it to pull over from Hellcrawl? (something I need to investigate)
-Any adjustments from how Hellcrawl’s system works?
Rework Hell effects
-Couldn't find branch with Hell effects rework, might have to work from scratch
Implement Virulence spell
-Spell level, schools, spellpower cap, any special features (like a spellpower boost)?
-How does the spell work with the different tiers of rPois 
  (-rPois/no resist/+rPois/immune to poison)?
-Need to make sure monsters can be affected by the Virulence effect 
  (it may only be a player-based effect at the moment)
